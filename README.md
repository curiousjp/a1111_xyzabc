# a1111_xyzabc
A fork of [xyz_grid.py](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/master/scripts/xyz_grid.py) to remove the grid drawing functionality and add more axes. 

Still under construction - particularly the parts that forecast the number of iterations / images to be performed, but it is working now, so I'm sticking it here as a backup.
